+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+


IN, NOT IN
You can select from members of a set with IN (or NOT IN) operator. This is easier and clearer than the equivalent AND-OR expression.

mysql> SELECT * FROM products WHERE name IN ('Pen Red', 'Pen Black');
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
| productID | productCode | name      | quantity | price |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
|      1001 | PEN         | Pen Red   |     5000 |  1.23 |
|      1003 | PEN         | Pen Black |     2000 |  1.25 |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
BETWEEN, NOT BETWEEN
To check if the value is within a range, you could use BETWEEN ... AND ... operator. Again, this is easier and clearer than the equivalent AND-OR expression.

mysql> SELECT * FROM products 
       WHERE (price BETWEEN 1.0 AND 2.0) AND (quantity BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000);
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
| productID | productCode | name      | quantity | price |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
|      1003 | PEN         | Pen Black |     2000 |  1.25 |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
NULL is a special value, which represent "no value", "missing value" or "unknown value". You can checking if a column contains NULL by IS NULL or IS NOT NULL. For example,

mysql> SELECT * FROM products WHERE productCode IS NULL;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
Using comparison operator (such as = or <>) to check for NULL is a mistake - a very common mistake. For example,

SELECT * FROM products WHERE productCode = NULL;
-- This is a common mistake. NULL cannot be compared.
ORDER BY Clause
You can order the rows selected using ORDER BY clause, with the following syntax:

SELECT ... FROM tableName
WHERE criteria
ORDER BY columnA ASC|DESC, columnB ASC|DESC, ...
The selected row will be ordered according to the values in columnA, in either ascending (ASC) (default) or descending (DESC) order. If several rows have the same value in columnA, it will be ordered according to columnB, and so on. For strings, the ordering could be case-sensitive or case-insensitive, depending on the so-called character collating sequence used. For examples,

-- Order the results by price in descending order
mysql> SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE 'Pen %' ORDER BY price DESC;
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
| productID | productCode | name      | quantity | price |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
|      1002 | PEN         | Pen Blue  |     8000 |  1.25 |
|      1003 | PEN         | Pen Black |     2000 |  1.25 |
|      1001 | PEN         | Pen Red   |     5000 |  1.23 |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
 
-- Order by price in descending order, followed by quantity in ascending (default) order
mysql> SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE 'Pen %' ORDER BY price DESC, quantity;
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
| productID | productCode | name      | quantity | price |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
|      1003 | PEN         | Pen Black |     2000 |  1.25 |
|      1002 | PEN         | Pen Blue  |     8000 |  1.25 |
|      1001 | PEN         | Pen Red   |     5000 |  1.23 |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
You can randomize the returned records via function RAND(), e.g.,

mysql> SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY RAND();
LIMIT Clause
A SELECT query on a large database may produce many rows. You could use the LIMIT clause to limit the number of rows displayed, e.g.,

-- Display the first two rows
mysql> SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price LIMIT 2;
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
| productID | productCode | name      | quantity | price |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
|      1004 | PEC         | Pencil 2B |    10000 |  0.48 |
|      1005 | PEC         | Pencil 2H |     8000 |  0.49 |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
To continue to the following records , you could specify the number of rows to be skipped, followed by the number of rows to be displayed in the LIMIT clause, as follows:

-- Skip the first two rows and display the next 1 row
mysql> SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price LIMIT 2, 1;
+-----------+-------------+---------+----------+-------+
| productID | productCode | name    | quantity | price |
+-----------+-------------+---------+----------+-------+
|      1001 | PEN         | Pen Red |     5000 |  1.23 |
+-----------+-------------+---------+----------+-------+
AS - Alias
You could use the keyword AS to define an alias for an identifier (such as column name, table name). The alias will be used in displaying the name. It can also be used as reference. For example,

mysql> SELECT productID AS ID, productCode AS Code,
              name AS Description, price AS `Unit Price`  -- Define aliases to be used as display names
       FROM products
       ORDER BY ID;  -- Use alias ID as reference
+------+------+-------------+------------+
| ID   | Code | Description | Unit Price |
+------+------+-------------+------------+
| 1001 | PEN  | Pen Red     |       1.23 |
| 1002 | PEN  | Pen Blue    |       1.25 |
| 1003 | PEN  | Pen Black   |       1.25 |
| 1004 | PEC  | Pencil 2B   |       0.48 |
| 1005 | PEC  | Pencil 2H   |       0.49 |
+------+------+-------------+------------+
Take note that the identifier "Unit Price" contains a blank and must be back-quoted.

Function CONCAT()
You can also concatenate a few columns as one (e.g., joining the last name and first name) using function CONCAT(). For example,

mysql> SELECT CONCAT(productCode, ' - ', name) AS `Product Description`, price FROM products;
+---------------------+-------+
| Product Description | price |
+---------------------+-------+
| PEN - Pen Red       |  1.23 |
| PEN - Pen Blue      |  1.25 |
| PEN - Pen Black     |  1.25 |
| PEC - Pencil 2B     |  0.48 |
| PEC - Pencil 2H     |  0.49 |
+---------------------+-------+
2.6  Producing Summary Reports
To produce a summary report, we often need to aggregate related rows.

DISTINCT
A column may have duplicate values, we could use keyword DISTINCT to select only distinct values. We can also apply DISTINCT to several columns to select distinct combinations of these columns. For examples,

-- Without DISTINCT
mysql> SELECT price FROM products;
+-------+
| price |
+-------+
|  1.23 |
|  1.25 |
|  1.25 |
|  0.48 |
|  0.49 |
+-------+
   
-- With DISTINCT on price
mysql> SELECT DISTINCT price AS `Distinct Price` FROM products;
+----------------+
| Distinct Price |
+----------------+
|           1.23 |
|           1.25 |
|           0.48 |
|           0.49 |
+----------------+
 
-- DISTINCT combination of price and name
mysql> SELECT DISTINCT price, name FROM products;
+-------+-----------+
| price | name      |
+-------+-----------+
|  1.23 | Pen Red   |
|  1.25 | Pen Blue  |
|  1.25 | Pen Black |
|  0.48 | Pencil 2B |
|  0.49 | Pencil 2H |
+-------+-----------+
GROUP BY Clause
The GROUP BY clause allows you to collapse multiple records with a common value into groups. For example,

mysql> SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY productCode, productID;
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
| productID | productCode | name      | quantity | price |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
|      1004 | PEC         | Pencil 2B |    10000 |  0.48 |
|      1005 | PEC         | Pencil 2H |     8000 |  0.49 |
|      1001 | PEN         | Pen Red   |     5000 |  1.23 |
|      1002 | PEN         | Pen Blue  |     8000 |  1.25 |
|      1003 | PEN         | Pen Black |     2000 |  1.25 |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
 
mysql> SELECT * FROM products GROUP BY productCode;
       -- Only first record in each group is shown
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
| productID | productCode | name      | quantity | price |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
|      1004 | PEC         | Pencil 2B |    10000 |  0.48 |
|      1001 | PEN         | Pen Red   |     5000 |  1.23 |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
GROUP BY by itself is not meaningful. It is used together with GROUP BY aggregate functions (such as COUNT(), AVG(), SUM()) to produce group summary.

GROUP BY Aggregate Functions: COUNT, MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM, STD, GROUP_CONCAT
We can apply GROUP BY Aggregate functions to each group to produce group summary report.

The function COUNT(*) returns the rows selected; COUNT(columnName) counts only the non-NULL values of the given column. For example,

-- Function COUNT(*) returns the number of rows selected
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) AS `Count` FROM products;
       -- All rows without GROUP BY clause
+-------+
| Count |
+-------+
|     5 |
+-------+
   
mysql> SELECT productCode, COUNT(*) FROM products GROUP BY productCode;
+-------------+----------+
| productCode | COUNT(*) |
+-------------+----------+
| PEC         |        2 |
| PEN         |        3 |
+-------------+----------+
 
-- Order by COUNT - need to define an alias to be used as reference
mysql> SELECT productCode, COUNT(*) AS count 
       FROM products 
       GROUP BY productCode
       ORDER BY count DESC;
+-------------+-------+
| productCode | count |
+-------------+-------+
| PEN         |     3 |
| PEC         |     2 |
+-------------+-------+
Besides COUNT(), there are many other GROUP BY aggregate functions such as AVG(), MAX(), MIN() and SUM(). For example,

mysql> SELECT MAX(price), MIN(price), AVG(price), STD(price), SUM(quantity)
       FROM products;
       -- Without GROUP BY - All rows
+------------+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
| MAX(price) | MIN(price) | AVG(price) | STD(price) | SUM(quantity) |
+------------+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
|       1.25 |       0.48 |   0.940000 |   0.371591 |         33000 |
+------------+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
 
mysql> SELECT productCode, MAX(price) AS `Highest Price`, MIN(price) AS `Lowest Price`
       FROM products
       GROUP BY productCode;
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| productCode | Highest Price | Lowest Price |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| PEC         |          0.49 |         0.48 |
| PEN         |          1.25 |         1.23 |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
 
mysql> SELECT productCode, MAX(price), MIN(price),
              CAST(AVG(price) AS DECIMAL(7,2)) AS `Average`,
              CAST(STD(price) AS DECIMAL(7,2)) AS `Std Dev`,
              SUM(quantity)
       FROM products
       GROUP BY productCode;
       -- Use CAST(... AS ...) function to format floating-point numbers
+-------------+------------+------------+---------+---------+---------------+
| productCode | MAX(price) | MIN(price) | Average | Std Dev | SUM(quantity) |
+-------------+------------+------------+---------+---------+---------------+
| PEC         |       0.49 |       0.48 |    0.49 |    0.01 |         18000 |
| PEN         |       1.25 |       1.23 |    1.24 |    0.01 |         15000 |
+-------------+------------+------------+---------+---------+---------------+
HAVING clause
HAVING is similar to WHERE, but it can operate on the GROUP BY aggregate functions; whereas WHERE operates only on columns.

mysql> SELECT
          productCode AS `Product Code`,
          COUNT(*) AS `Count`,
          CAST(AVG(price) AS DECIMAL(7,2)) AS `Average`
       FROM products 
       GROUP BY productCode
       HAVING Count >=3;
          -- CANNOT use WHERE count >= 3
+--------------+-------+---------+
| Product Code | Count | Average |
+--------------+-------+---------+
| PEN          |     3 |    1.24 |
+--------------+-------+---------+
WITH ROLLUP
The WITH ROLLUP clause shows the summary of group summary, e.g.,

mysql> SELECT 
          productCode, 
          MAX(price), 
          MIN(price), 
          CAST(AVG(price) AS DECIMAL(7,2)) AS `Average`,
          SUM(quantity)
       FROM products
       GROUP BY productCode
       WITH ROLLUP;        -- Apply aggregate functions to all groups
+-------------+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| productCode | MAX(price) | MIN(price) | Average | SUM(quantity) |
+-------------+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| PEC         |       0.49 |       0.48 |    0.49 |         18000 |
| PEN         |       1.25 |       1.23 |    1.24 |         15000 |
| NULL        |       1.25 |       0.48 |    0.94 |         33000 |
+-------------+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
2.7  Modifying Data - UPDATE
To modify existing data, use UPDATE ... SET command, with the following syntax:

UPDATE tableName SET columnName = {value|NULL|DEFAULT}, ... WHERE criteria
For example,

-- Increase the price by 10% for all products
mysql> UPDATE products SET price = price * 1.1;
   
mysql> SELECT * FROM products;
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
| productID | productCode | name      | quantity | price |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
|      1001 | PEN         | Pen Red   |     5000 |  1.35 |
|      1002 | PEN         | Pen Blue  |     8000 |  1.38 |
|      1003 | PEN         | Pen Black |     2000 |  1.38 |
|      1004 | PEC         | Pencil 2B |    10000 |  0.53 |
|      1005 | PEC         | Pencil 2H |     8000 |  0.54 |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
   
-- Modify selected rows
mysql> UPDATE products SET quantity = quantity - 100 WHERE name = 'Pen Red';
   
mysql> SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = 'Pen Red';
+-----------+-------------+---------+----------+-------+
| productID | productCode | name    | quantity | price |
+-----------+-------------+---------+----------+-------+
|      1001 | PEN         | Pen Red |     4900 |  1.35 |
+-----------+-------------+---------+----------+-------+
   
-- You can modify more than one values
mysql> UPDATE products SET quantity = quantity + 50, price = 1.23 WHERE name = 'Pen Red';
   
mysql> SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = 'Pen Red';
+-----------+-------------+---------+----------+-------+
| productID | productCode | name    | quantity | price |
+-----------+-------------+---------+----------+-------+
|      1001 | PEN         | Pen Red |     4950 |  1.23 |
+-----------+-------------+---------+----------+-------+
CAUTION: If the WHERE clause is omitted in the UPDATE command, ALL ROWS will be updated. Hence, it is a good practice to issue a SELECT query, using the same criteria, to check the result set before issuing the UPDATE. This also applies to the DELETE statement in the following section.

2.8  Deleting Rows - DELETE FROM
Use the DELELE FROM command to delete row(s) from a table, with the following syntax:

-- Delete all rows from the table. Use with extreme care! Records are NOT recoverable!!!
DELETE FROM tableName
-- Delete only row(s) that meets the criteria
DELETE FROM tableName WHERE criteria
For example,

mysql> DELETE FROM products WHERE name LIKE 'Pencil%';
Query OK, 2 row affected (0.00 sec)
   
mysql> SELECT * FROM products;
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
| productID | productCode | name      | quantity | price |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
|      1001 | PEN         | Pen Red   |     4950 |  1.23 |
|      1002 | PEN         | Pen Blue  |     8000 |  1.38 |
|      1003 | PEN         | Pen Black |     2000 |  1.38 |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
  
-- Use this with extreme care, as the deleted records are irrecoverable!
mysql> DELETE FROM products;
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
   
mysql> SELECT * FROM products;
Empty set (0.00 sec)
Beware that "DELETE FROM tableName" without a WHERE clause deletes ALL records from the table. Even with a WHERE clause, you might have deleted some records unintentionally. It is always advisable to issue a SELECT command with the same WHERE clause to check the result set before issuing the DELETE (and UPDATE).

2.9  Loading/Exporting Data from/to a Text File
There are several ways to add data into the database: (a) manually issue the INSERT commands; (b) run the INSERT commands from a script; or (c) load raw data from a file using LOAD DATA or via mysqlimport utility.

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE ... INTO TABLE ...
Besides using INSERT commands to insert rows, you could keep your raw data in a text file, and load them into the table via the LOAD DATA command. For example, use a text editor to CREATE a NEW FILE called "products_in.csv", under "d:\myProject" (for Windows) or "Documents" (for Mac), containing the following records, where the values are separated by ','. The file extension of ".csv" stands for Comma-Separated Values text file.

\N,PEC,Pencil 3B,500,0.52
\N,PEC,Pencil 4B,200,0.62
\N,PEC,Pencil 5B,100,0.73
\N,PEC,Pencil 6B,500,0.47
You can load the raw data into the products table as follows:

(For Windows)
-- Need to use forward-slash (instead of back-slash) as directory separator
mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'd:/myProject/products_in.csv' INTO TABLE products
         COLUMNS TERMINATED BY ','
         LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n';
 
(For Macs)
mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '~/Documents/products_in.csv' INTO TABLE products
         COLUMNS TERMINATED BY ',';
mysql> SELECT * FROM products;
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
| productID | productCode | name      | quantity | price |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
|      1007 | PEC         | Pencil 3B |      500 |  0.52 |
|      1008 | PEC         | Pencil 4B |      200 |  0.62 |
|      1009 | PEC         | Pencil 5B |      100 |  0.73 |
|      1010 | PEC         | Pencil 6B |      500 |  0.47 |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+
Notes:

You need to provide the path (absolute or relative) and the filename. Use Unix-style forward-slash '/' as the directory separator, instead of Windows-style back-slash '\'.
The default line delimiter (or end-of-line) is '\n' (Unix-style). If the text file is prepared in Windows, you need to include LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'.
The default column delimiter is "tab" (in a so-called TSV file - Tab-Separated Values). If you use another delimiter, e.g. ',', include COLUMNS TERMINATED BY ','.
You need to use \N for NULL.
mysqlimport Utility Program
You can also use the mysqlimport utility program to load data from a text file.

-- SYNTAX
> mysqlimport -u username -p --local databaseName tableName.tsv
   -- The raw data must be kept in a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file with filename the same as tablename
 
-- EXAMPLES
-- Create a new file called "products.tsv" containing the following record,
--  and saved under "d:\myProject" (for Windows) or "Documents" (for Mac)
-- The values are separated by tab (not spaces).
\N  PEC  Pencil 3B  500  0.52
\N  PEC  Pencil 4B  200  0.62
\N  PEC  Pencil 5B  100  0.73
\N  PEC  Pencil 6B  500  0.47

(For Windows)
> cd path-to-mysql-bin
> mysqlimport -u root -p --local southwind d:/myProject/products.tsv

(For Macs)
$ cd /usr/local/mysql/bin
$ ./mysqlimport -u root -p --local southwind ~/Documents/products.tsv
SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE ...
Complimenting LOAD DATA command, you can use SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE fileName FROM tableName to export data from a table to a text file. For example,

(For Windows)
mysql> SELECT * FROM products INTO OUTFILE 'd:/myProject/products_out.csv' 
         COLUMNS TERMINATED BY ','
         LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n';
 
(For Macs)
mysql> SELECT * FROM products INTO OUTFILE '~/Documents/products_out.csv'
         COLUMNS TERMINATED BY ',';
2.10  Running a SQL Script
Instead of manually entering each of the SQL statements, you can keep many SQL statements in a text file, called SQL script, and run the script. For example, use a programming text editor to prepare the following script and save as "load_products.sql" under "d:\myProject" (for Windows) or "Documents" (for Mac).

DELETE FROM products;
INSERT INTO products VALUES (2001, 'PEC', 'Pencil 3B', 500, 0.52),
                            (NULL, 'PEC', 'Pencil 4B', 200, 0.62),
                            (NULL, 'PEC', 'Pencil 5B', 100, 0.73),
                            (NULL, 'PEC', 'Pencil 6B', 500, 0.47);
SELECT * FROM products;
You can run the script either:

via the "source" command in a MySQL client. For example, to restore the southwind backup earlier:
(For Windows)
mysql> source d:/myProject/load_products.sql
   -- Use Unix-style forward slash (/) as directory separator
 
(For Macs)
mysql> source ~/Documents/load_products.sql
via the "batch mode" of the mysql client program, by re-directing the input from the script:
(For Windows)
> cd path-to-mysql-bin
> mysql -u root -p southwind < d:\myProject\load_products.sql
 
(For Macs)
$ cd /usr/local/mysql/bin
$ ./mysql -u root -p southwind < ~\Documents\load_products.sql
3.  More Than One Tables
Our example so far involves only one table "products". A practical database contains many related tables.

Products have suppliers. If each product has one supplier, and each supplier supplies only one product (known as one-to-one relationship), we can simply add the supplier's data (name, address, phone number) into the products table. Suppose that each product has one supplier, and a supplier may supply zero or more products (known as one-to-many relationship). Putting the supplier's data into the products table results in duplication of data. This is because one supplier may supply many products, hence, the same supplier's data appear in many rows. This not only wastes the storage but also easily leads to inconsistency (as all duplicate data must be updated simultaneously). The situation is even more complicated if one product has many suppliers, and each supplier can supply many products, in a many-to-many relationship.

3.1  One-To-Many Relationship
Suppose that each product has one supplier, and each supplier supplies one or more products. We could create a table called suppliers to store suppliers' data (e.g., name, address and phone number). We create a column with unique value called supplierID to identify every suppliers. We set supplierID as the primary key for the table suppliers (to ensure uniqueness and facilitate fast search).

To relate the suppliers table to the products table, we add a new column into the products table - the supplierID. We then set the supplierID column of the products table as a foreign key references the supplierID column of the suppliers table to ensure the so-called referential integrity.

Database: southwind
Table: suppliers
supplierID
INT	name
VARCHAR(3)	phone
CHAR(8)
501	ABC Traders	88881111
502	XYZ Company	88882222
503	QQ Corp	88883333

Database: southwind
Table: products
productID
INT	productCode
CHAR(3)	name
VARCHAR(30)	quantity
INT	price
DECIMAL(10,2)	supplierID
INT
(Foreign Key)
2001	PEC	Pencil 3B	500	0.52	501
2002	PEC	Pencil 4B	200	0.62	501
2003	PEC	Pencil 5B	100	0.73	501
2004	PEC	Pencil 6B	500	0.47	502
We need to first create the suppliers table, because the products table references the suppliers table. The suppliers table is known as the parent table; while the products table is known as the child table in this relationship.

mysql> USE southwind;
   
mysql> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS suppliers;
   
mysql> CREATE TABLE suppliers (
         supplierID  INT UNSIGNED  NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
         name        VARCHAR(30)   NOT NULL DEFAULT '', 
         phone       CHAR(8)       NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
         PRIMARY KEY (supplierID)
       );
   
mysql> DESCRIBE suppliers;
+------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field      | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| supplierID | int(10) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| name       | varchar(30)      | NO   |     |         |                |
| phone      | char(8)          | NO   |     |         |                |
+------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
   
mysql> INSERT INTO suppliers VALUE
          (501, 'ABC Traders', '88881111'), 
          (502, 'XYZ Company', '88882222'), 
          (503, 'QQ Corp', '88883333');
   
mysql> SELECT * FROM suppliers;
+------------+-------------+----------+
| supplierID | name        | phone    |
+------------+-------------+----------+
|        501 | ABC Traders | 88881111 |
|        502 | XYZ Company | 88882222 |
|        503 | QQ Corp     | 88883333 |
+------------+-------------+----------+
ALTER TABLE
Instead of deleting and re-creating the products table, we shall use "ALTER TABLE" to add a new column supplierID into the products table.

mysql> ALTER TABLE products
       ADD COLUMN supplierID INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL;
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.13 sec)
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
   
mysql> DESCRIBE products;
+-------------+------------------+------+-----+------------+----------------+
| Field       | Type             | Null | Key | Default    | Extra          |
+-------------+------------------+------+-----+------------+----------------+
| productID   | int(10) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL       | auto_increment |
| productCode | char(3)          | NO   |     |            |                |
| name        | varchar(30)      | NO   |     |            |                |
| quantity    | int(10) unsigned | NO   |     | 0          |                |
| price       | decimal(10,2)    | NO   |     | 9999999.99 |                |
| supplierID  | int(10) unsigned | NO   |     | NULL       |                |
+-------------+------------------+------+-----+------------+----------------+
Next, we shall add a foreign key constraint on the supplierID columns of the products child table to the suppliers parent table, to ensure that every supplierID in the products table always refers to a valid supplierID in the suppliers table - this is called referential integrity.

Before we can add the foreign key, we need to set the supplierID of the existing records in the products table to a valid supplierID in the suppliers table (say supplierID=501).

-- Set the supplierID of the existing records in "products" table to a VALID supplierID
--   of "suppliers" table
mysql> UPDATE products SET supplierID = 501;
 
-- Add a foreign key constrain
mysql> ALTER TABLE products
       ADD FOREIGN KEY (supplierID) REFERENCES suppliers (supplierID);
 
mysql> DESCRIBE products;
+-------------+------------------+------+-----+------------+----------------+
| Field       | Type             | Null | Key | Default    | Extra          |
+-------------+------------------+------+-----+------------+----------------+
  ......
| supplierID  | int(10) unsigned | NO   | MUL |            |                |
+-------------+------------------+------+-----+------------+----------------+
 
mysql> UPDATE products SET supplierID = 502 WHERE productID  = 2004;
  -- Choose a valid productID
   
mysql> SELECT * FROM products;
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+------------+
| productID | productCode | name      | quantity | price | supplierID |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+------------+
|      2001 | PEC         | Pencil 3B |      500 |  0.52 |        501 |
|      2002 | PEC         | Pencil 4B |      200 |  0.62 |        501 |
|      2003 | PEC         | Pencil 5B |      100 |  0.73 |        501 |
|      2004 | PEC         | Pencil 6B |      500 |  0.47 |        502 |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------+------------+
SELECT with JOIN
SELECT command can be used to query and join data from two related tables. For example, to list the product's name (in products table) and supplier's name (in suppliers table), we could join the two table via the two common supplierID columns:

-- ANSI style: JOIN ... ON ...
mysql> SELECT products.name, price, suppliers.name 
       FROM products 
          JOIN suppliers ON products.supplierID = suppliers.supplierID
       WHERE price < 0.6;
+-----------+-------+-------------+
| name      | price | name        |
+-----------+-------+-------------+
| Pencil 3B |  0.52 | ABC Traders |
| Pencil 6B |  0.47 | XYZ Company |
+-----------+-------+-------------+
    -- Need to use products.name and suppliers.name to differentiate the two "names"
 
-- Join via WHERE clause (lagacy and not recommended)
mysql> SELECT products.name, price, suppliers.name 
       FROM products, suppliers 
       WHERE products.supplierID = suppliers.supplierID
          AND price < 0.6;
+-----------+-------+-------------+
| name      | price | name        |
+-----------+-------+-------------+
| Pencil 3B |  0.52 | ABC Traders |

In the above query result, two of the columns have the same heading "name". We could create aliases for headings.

-- Use aliases for column names for display
mysql> SELECT products.name AS `Product Name`, price, suppliers.name AS `Supplier Name` 
       FROM products 
          JOIN suppliers ON products.supplierID = suppliers.supplierID
       WHERE price < 0.6;

       The database diagram is as illustrated. The link indicates a one-to-many relationship between products and suppliers.

3.2  Many-To-Many Relationship
Suppose that a product has many suppliers; and a supplier supplies many products in a so-called many-to-many relationship. The above solution breaks. You cannot include the supplierID in the products table, as you cannot determine the number of suppliers, and hence, the number of columns needed for the supplierIDs. Similarly, you cannot include the productID in the suppliers table, as you cannot determine the number of products.

To resolve this problem, you need to create a new table, known as a junction table (or joint table), to provide the linkage. Let's call the junction table products_suppliers, as illustrated.

Database: southwind
Table: products_suppliers
productID
INT
(Foreign Key)	supplierID
INT

2001	501
2002	501
2003	501

2001	503

VARCHAR(30)	phone
CHAR(8)
501	ABC Traders	88881111
502	XYZ Company	88882222
503	QQ Corp	88883333

Database: southwind
Table: products
productID
INT	productCode
CHAR(3)	name
VARCHAR(30)	quantity
INT	price
DECIMAL(10,2)
2001	PEC	Pencil 3B	500	0.52
2002	PEC	Pencil 4B	200	0.62
2003	PEC	Pencil 5B	100	0.73
2004	PEC	Pencil 6B	500	0.47
Let's create the products_suppliers table. The primary key of the table consists of two columns: productID and supplierID, as their combination uniquely identifies each rows. This primary key is defined to ensure uniqueness. Two foreign keys are defined to set the constraint to the two parent tables.

mysql> CREATE TABLE products_suppliers (
         productID   INT UNSIGNED  NOT NULL,
         supplierID  INT UNSIGNED  NOT NULL,
                     -- Same data types as the parent tables
         PRIMARY KEY (productID, supplierID),
                     -- uniqueness
         FOREIGN KEY (productID)  REFERENCES products  (productID),
         FOREIGN KEY (supplierID) REFERENCES suppliers (supplierID)
       );
   
mysql> DESCRIBE products_suppliers;
+------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field      | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| productID  | int(10) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| supplierID | int(10) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
+------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
  
mysql> INSERT INTO products_suppliers VALUES (2001, 501), (2002, 501),
       (2003, 501), (2004, 502), (2001, 503);
-- Values in the foreign-key columns (of the child table) must match 
--   valid values in the columns they reference (of the parent table)
   
mysql> SELECT * FROM products_suppliers;
+-----------+------------+
| productID | supplierID |
+-----------+------------+
|      2001 |        501 |
|      2002 |        501 |
|      2003 |        501 |
|      2004 |        502 |
|      2001 |        503 |
+-----------+------------+
Next, remove the supplierID column from the products table. (This column was added to establish the one-to-many relationship. It is no longer needed in the many-to-many relationship.)

Before this column can be removed, you need to remove the foreign key that builds on this column. To remove a key in MySQL, you need to know its constraint name, which was generated by the system. To find the constraint name, issue a "SHOW CREATE TABLE products" and take note of the foreign key's constraint name in the clause "CONSTRAINT constraint_name FOREIGN KEY ....". You can then drop the foreign key using "ALTER TABLE products DROP FOREIGN KEY constraint_name"

mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE products \G
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `products` (
  `productID`   int(10) unsigned  NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `productCode` char(3)           NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `name`        varchar(30)       NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `quantity`    int(10) unsigned  NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `price`       decimal(7,2)      NOT NULL DEFAULT '99999.99',
  `supplierID`  int(10) unsigned   NOT NULL DEFAULT '501',
  PRIMARY KEY (`productID`),
  KEY `supplierID` (`supplierID`),
  CONSTRAINT `products_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`supplierID`) 
     REFERENCES `suppliers` (`supplierID`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1006 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1
 
mysql> ALTER TABLE products DROP FOREIGN KEY products_ibfk_1;

mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE products \G
Now, we can remove the column redundant supplierID column.

mysql> ALTER TABLE products DROP supplierID;
 
mysql> DESC products;
Querying
Similarly, we can use SELECT with JOIN to query data from the 3 tables, for examples,

mysql> SELECT products.name AS `Product Name`, price, suppliers.name AS `Supplier Name`
       FROM products_suppliers 
          JOIN products  ON products_suppliers.productID = products.productID
          JOIN suppliers ON products_suppliers.supplierID = suppliers.supplierID
       WHERE price < 0.6;
+--------------+-------+---------------+
| Product Name | price | Supplier Name |
+--------------+-------+---------------+
| Pencil 3B    |  0.52 | ABC Traders   |
| Pencil 3B    |  0.52 | QQ Corp       |
| Pencil 6B    |  0.47 | XYZ Company   |
+--------------+-------+---------------+

-- Define aliases for tablenames too 
mysql> SELECT p.name AS `Product Name`, s.name AS `Supplier Name`
       FROM products_suppliers AS ps 
          JOIN products AS p ON ps.productID = p.productID
          JOIN suppliers AS s ON ps.supplierID = s.supplierID
       WHERE p.name = 'Pencil 3B';
+--------------+---------------+
| Product Name | Supplier Name |
+--------------+---------------+
| Pencil 3B    | ABC Traders   |
| Pencil 3B    | QQ Corp       |
+--------------+---------------+
  
-- Using WHERE clause to join (legacy and not recommended)
mysql> SELECT p.name AS `Product Name`, s.name AS `Supplier Name`
       FROM products AS p, products_suppliers AS ps, suppliers AS s
       WHERE p.productID = ps.productID
          AND ps.supplierID = s.supplierID
          AND s.name = 'ABC Traders';
+--------------+---------------+
| Product Name | Supplier Name |
+--------------+---------------+
| Pencil 3B    | ABC Traders   |
| Pencil 4B    | ABC Traders   |
| Pencil 5B    | ABC Traders   |
+--------------+---------------+
The database diagram is as follows. Both products and suppliers tables exhibit a one-to-many relationship to the junction table. The many-to-many relationship is supported via the junction table.

Database diagram
3.3  One-to-one Relationship
Suppose that some products have optional data (e.g., photo, comment). Instead of keeping these optional data in the products table, it is more efficient to create another table called product_details, and link it to products with a one-to-one relationship, as illustrated.

Database diagram
mysql> CREATE TABLE product_details (
          productID  INT UNSIGNED   NOT NULL,
                     -- same data type as the parent table
          comment    TEXT  NULL,
                     -- up to 64KB
          PRIMARY KEY (productID),
          FOREIGN KEY (productID) REFERENCES products (productID)
       );

mysql> DESCRIBE product_details;
+-----------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field     | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-----------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| productID | int(10) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| comment   | text             | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-----------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+

mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE product_details \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: product_details

  CONSTRAINT `product_details_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`productID`) REFERENCES `products` (`productID`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1
3.4  Backup and Restore
Backup: Before we conclude this example, let's run the mysqldump utility program to dump out (backup) the entire southwind database.

(For Windows)
-- Start a NEW "cmd"
> cd path-to-mysql-bin
> mysqldump -u root -p --databases southwind > "d:\myProject\backup_southwind.sql"
 
(For Macs)
-- Start a NEW "terminal"
$ cd /usr/local/mysql/bin
$ ./mysqldump -u root -p --databases southwind > ~/Documents/backup_southwind.sql
Study the output file, which contains CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements to re-create the tables dumped.

The SYNTAX for the mysqldump utility program is as follows:

-- Dump selected databases with --databases option
> mysqldump -u username -p --databases database1Name [database2Name ...] > backupFile.sql
-- Dump all databases in the server with --all-databases option, except mysql.user table (for security)
> mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases --ignore-table=mysql.user > backupServer.sql
  
-- Dump all the tables of a particular database
> mysqldump -u username -p databaseName > backupFile.sql
-- Dump selected tables of a particular database
> mysqldump -u username -p databaseName table1Name [table2Name ...] > backupFile.sql
Restore: The utility mysqldump produces a SQL script (consisting of CREATE TABLE and INSERT commands to re-create the tables and loading their data). You can restore from the backup by running the script either:

via the "source" command in an interactive client. For example, to restore the southwind backup earlier:
(For Windows)
-- Start a MySQL client
mysql> source d:/myProject/backup_southwind.sql
   -- Provide absolute or relative filename of the script
   -- Use Unix-style forward slash (/) as path separator
 
(For Macs)
-- Start a MySQL client
mysql> source ~/Documents/backup_southwind.sql
via the "batch mode" of the mysql client program by re-directing the input from the script:
(For Windows)
-- Start a NEW "cmd"
> cd path-to-mysql-bin
> mysql -u root -p southwind < d:\myProject\backup_southwind.sql
 
(For Macs)
-- Start a NEW "terminal"
$ cd /usr/local/mysql/bin
$ ./mysql -u root -p southwind < ~/Documents/backup_southwind.sql
4.  More on Primary Key, Foreign Key and Index
4.1  Primary Key
In the relational model, a table shall not contain duplicate rows, because that would create ambiguity in retrieval. To ensure uniqueness, each table should have a column (or a set of columns), called primary key, that uniquely identifies every record of the table. For example, an unique number customerID can be used as the primary key for the customers table; productCode for products table; isbn for books table. A primary key is called a simple key if it is a single column; it is called a composite key if it is made up of several columns. Most RDBMSs build an index on the primary key to facilitate fast search. The primary key is often used to relate to other tables.

4.2  Foreign Key
A foreign key of a child table is used to reference the parent table. Foreign key constraint can be imposed to ensure so-called referential integrity - values in the child table must be valid values in the parent table.

We define the foreign key when defining the child table, which references a parent table, as follows:

-- Child table definition
CREATE TABLE tableName (
   ......
   ......
   CONSTRAINT constraintName FOREIGN KEY (columName) REFERENCES parentTableName (columnName)
     [ON DELETE RESTRICT | CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION]   -- On DELETE reference action
     [ON UPDATE RESTRICT | CASCADE | SET NULL | NO ACTION]   -- On UPDATE reference action
)
You can specify the reference action for UPDATE and DELETE via the optional ON UPDATE and ON DELETE clauses:

RESTRICT (default): disallow DELETE or UPDATE of the parent's row, if there are matching rows in child table.
CASCADE: cascade the DELETE or UPDATE action to the matching rows in the child table.
SET NULL: set the foreign key value in the child table to NULL (if NULL is allowed).
NO ACTION: a SQL term which means no action on the parent's row. Same as RESTRICT in MySQL, which disallows DELETE or UPDATE (do nothing).
Try deleting a record in the suppliers (parent) table that is referenced by products_suppliers (child) table, e.g.,

mysql> SELECT * FROM products_suppliers;
+-----------+------------+
| productID | supplierID |
+-----------+------------+
|      2001 |        501 |
|      2002 |        501 |
|      2003 |        501 |
|      2004 |        502 |
|      2001 |        503 |
+-----------+------------+
 
-- Try deleting a row from parent table with matching rows in the child table
mysql> DELETE FROM suppliers WHERE supplierID = 501;
ERROR 1451 (23000): Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails 
(`southwind`.`products_suppliers`, CONSTRAINT `products_suppliers_ibfk_2` 
FOREIGN KEY (`supplierID`) REFERENCES `suppliers` (`supplierID`))
The record cannot be deleted as the default "ON DELETE RESTRICT" constraint was imposed.

4.3  Indexes (or Keys)
Indexes (or Keys) can be created on selected column(s) to facilitate fast search. Without index, a "SELECT * FROM products WHERE productID=x" needs to match with the productID column of all the records in the products table. If productID column is indexed (e.g., using a binary tree), the matching can be greatly improved (via the binary tree search).

You should index columns which are frequently used in the WHERE clause; and as JOIN columns.

The drawback about indexing is cost and space. Building and maintaining indexes require computations and memory spaces. Indexes facilitate fast search but deplete the performance on modifying the table (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE), and need to be justified. Nevertheless, relational databases are typically optimized for queries and retrievals, but NOT for updates.

In MySQL, the keyword KEY is synonym to INDEX.

In MySQL, indexes can be built on:

a single column (column-index)
a set of columns (concatenated-index)
on unique-value column (UNIQUE INDEX or UNIQUE KEY)
on a prefix of a column for strings (VARCHAR or CHAR), e.g., first 5 characters.
There can be more than one indexes in a table. Index are automatically built on the primary-key column(s).

You can build index via CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX or ALTER TABLE.

CREATE TABLE tableName (
   ......
   [UNIQUE] INDEX|KEY indexName (columnName, ...),
      -- The optional keyword UNIQUE ensures that all values in this column are distinct
      -- KEY is synonym to INDEX
   ......
   PRIMAY KEY (columnName, ...)  -- Index automatically built on PRIMARY KEY column
);
 
CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX indexName ON tableName(columnName, ...);
 
ALTER TABLE tableName ADD UNIQUE|INDEX|PRIMARY KEY indexName (columnName, ...)
 
SHOW INDEX FROM tableName;
Example
mysql> CREATE TABLE employees (
          emp_no      INT UNSIGNED   NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
          name        VARCHAR(50)    NOT NULL,

       );

5.  More SQL
5.1  Sub-Query
Results of one query can be used in another SQL statement. Subquery is useful if more than one tables are involved.

SELECT with Subquery
In the previous many-to-many product sales example, how to find the suppliers that do not supply any product? You can query for the suppliers that supply at least one product in the products_suppliers table, and then query the suppliers table for those that are not in the previous result set.

mysql> SELECT suppliers.name from suppliers
       WHERE suppliers.supplierID
          NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT supplierID from products_suppliers);
Can you do this without sub-query?

A subquery may return a scalar, a single column, a single row, or a table. You can use comparison operator (e.g., '=', '>') on scalar, IN or NOT IN for single row or column, EXISTS or NOT EXIST to test for empty set.

INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE with Subquery
You can also use a subquery with other SQL statements such as INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE. For example,

-- Supplier 'QQ Corp' now supplies 'Pencil 6B'
-- You need to put the SELECT subqueies in parentheses
mysql> INSERT INTO products_suppliers VALUES (
          (SELECT productID  FROM products  WHERE name = 'Pencil 6B'),
          (SELECT supplierID FROM suppliers WHERE name = 'QQ Corp'));
 
-- Supplier 'QQ Copr' no longer supplies any item
mysql> DELETE FROM products_suppliers
       WHERE supplierID = (SELECT supplierID FROM suppliers WHERE name = 'QQ Corp');
5.2  Working with Date and Time
Date and time are of particular interest for database applications. This is because business records often carry date/time information (e.g., orderDate, deliveryDate, paymentDate, dateOfBirth), as well as the need to time-stamp the creation and last-update of the records for auditing and security.

With date/time data types, you can sort the results by date, search for a particular date or a range of dates, calculate the difference between dates, compute a new date by adding/subtracting an interval from a given date.

Date By Example
Let's begin with Date (without Time) with the following example. Take note that date value must be written as a string in the format of 'yyyy-mm-dd', e.g., '2012-01-31'.

-- Create a table 'patients' of a clinic
mysql> CREATE TABLE patients (
          patientID      INT UNSIGNED  NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
          name           VARCHAR(30)   NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
          dateOfBirth    DATE          NOT NULL,
          lastVisitDate  DATE          NOT NULL,
          nextVisitDate  DATE          NULL,
                         -- The 'Date' type contains a date value in 'yyyy-mm-dd'
          PRIMARY KEY (patientID)
       );
 
mysql> INSERT INTO patients VALUES
          (1001, 'Ah Teck', '1991-12-31', '2012-01-20', NULL),
          (NULL, 'Kumar', '2011-10-29', '2012-09-20', NULL),
          (NULL, 'Ali', '2011-01-30', CURDATE(), NULL);
-- Date must be written as 'yyyy-mm-dd'
-- Function CURDATE() returns today's date
 
mysql> SELECT * FROM patients;
+-----------+---------+-------------+---------------+---------------+
| patientID | name    | dateOfBirth | lastVisitDate | nextVisitDate |
+-----------+---------+-------------+---------------+---------------+

Date/Time Functions
MySQL provides these built-in functions for getting the current date, time and datetime:

NOW(): returns the current date and time in the format of 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.
CURDATE() (or CURRENT_DATE(), or CURRENT_DATE): returns the current date in the format of 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
CURTIME() (or CURRENT_TIME(), or CURRENT_TIME): returns the current time in the format of 'HH:MM:SS'.
For examples,

mysql> select now(), curdate(), curtime();
+---------------------+------------+-----------+
| now()               | curdate()  | curtime() |
+---------------------+------------+-----------+
| 2012-10-19 19:53:20 | 2012-10-19 | 19:53:20  |
+---------------------+------------+-----------+
SQL Date/Time Types
MySQL provides these date/time data types:

DATETIME: stores both date and time in the format of 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. The valid range is '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'. You can set a value using the valid format (e.g., '2011-08-15 00:00:00'). You could also apply functions NOW() or CURDATE() (time will be set to '00:00:00'), but not CURTIME().
DATE: stores date only in the format of 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The range is '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'. You could apply CURDATE() or NOW() (the time discarded) on this field.
TIME: stores time only in the format of 'HH:MM:SS'. You could apply CURTIME() or NOW() (the date discarded) for this field.
YEAR(4|2): in 'YYYY' or 'YY'. The range of years is 1901 to 2155. Use DATE type for year outside this range. You could apply CURDATE() to this field (month and day discarded).
TIMESTAMP: similar to DATETIME but stored the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC (Unix-style). The range is '1970-01-01 00:00:00' to '2037-12-31 23:59:59'.
The differences between DATETIME and TIMESTAMP are:
the range,
support for time zone,
TIMESTAMP column could be declared with DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP to set the default value to the current date/time. (All other data types' default, including DATETIME, must be a constant and not a function return value). You can also declare a TIMESTAMP column with "ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP" to capture the timestamp of the last update.
The date/time value can be entered manually as a string literal (e.g., '2010-12-31 23:59:59' for DATAETIME). MySQL will issue a warning and insert all zeros (e.g., '0000-00-00 00:00:00' for DATAETIME), if the value of date/time to be inserted is invalid or out-of-range. '0000-00-00' is called a "dummy" date.

More Date/Time Functions
Reference: MySQL's "Date and Time Functions" @ http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/date-and-time-functions.html.

There are many date/time functions:

Extracting part of a date/time: YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY(), HOUR(), MINUTE(), SECOND(), e.g.,
mysql> SELECT YEAR(NOW()), MONTH(NOW()), DAY(NOW()), HOUR(NOW()), MINUTE(NOW()), SECOND(NOW());
+-------------+--------------+------------+-------------+---------------+---------------+
| YEAR(NOW()) | MONTH(NOW()) | DAY(NOW()) | HOUR(NOW()) | MINUTE(NOW()) | SECOND(NOW()) |
+-------------+--------------+------------+-------------+---------------+---------------+
|        2012 |           10 |         24 |          11 |            54 |     45        |
+-------------+--------------+------------+-------------+---------------+---------------+
Extracting information: DAYNAME() (e.g., 'Monday'), MONTHNAME() (e.g., 'March'), DAYOFWEEK() (1=Sunday, …, 7=Saturday), DAYOFYEAR() (1-366), ...
mysql> SELECT DAYNAME(NOW()), MONTHNAME(NOW()), DAYOFWEEK(NOW()), DAYOFYEAR(NOW());
+----------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| DAYNAME(NOW()) | MONTHNAME(NOW()) | DAYOFWEEK(NOW()) | DAYOFYEAR(NOW()) |
+----------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| Wednesday      | October          |                4 |              298 |
+----------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
Computing another date/time: DATE_SUB(date, INTERVAL expr unit), DATE_ADD(date, INTERVAL expr unit), TIMESTAMPADD(unit, interval, timestamp), e.g.,
mysql> SELECT DATE_ADD('2012-01-31', INTERVAL 5 DAY);
2012-02-05
 
mysql> SELECT DATE_SUB('2012-01-31', INTERVAL 2 MONTH);
2011-11-30
Computing interval: DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date), TIMEDIFF(end_time, start_time), TIMESTAMPDIFF(unit, start_timestamp, end_timestamp), e.g.,
mysql> SELECT DATEDIFF('2012-02-01', '2012-01-28');
4
 
mysql> SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, '2012-02-01', '2012-01-28');
-4
Representation: TO_DAYS(date) (days since year 0), FROM_DAYS(day_number), e.g.,
mysql> SELECT TO_DAYS('2012-01-31');
734898
 
mysql> SELECT FROM_DAYS(734899);
2012-02-01
Formatting: DATE_FORMAT(date, formatSpecifier), e.g.,
mysql> SELECT DATE_FORMAT('2012-01-01', '%W %D %M %Y');
Sunday 1st January 2012
       -- %W: Weekday name
       -- %D: Day with suffix
       -- %M: Month name
       -- %Y: 4-digit year
       -- The format specifiers are case-sensitive
 
mysql> SELECT DATE_FORMAT('2011-12-31 23:59:30', '%W %D %M %Y %r');
Saturday 31st December 2011 11:59:30 PM
       -- %r: Time in 12-hour format with suffix AM/PM
Example
Create a table with various date/time columns. Only the TIMESTAMP column can have the DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.
mysql> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `datetime_arena` (
          `description`  VARCHAR(50)  DEFAULT NULL,
          `cDateTime`    DATETIME     DEFAULT '1000-01-01  00:00:00',
          `cDate`        DATE         DEFAULT '1000-01-01 ',
          `cTime`        TIME         DEFAULT '00:00:00',
          `cYear`        YEAR         DEFAULT '0000',
          `cYear2`       YEAR(2)      DEFAULT '0000',
          `cTimeStamp`   TIMESTAMP    DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
       );
 
mysql> DESCRIBE `datetime_arena`;
+-------------+-------------+------+-----+---------------------+-----------------------------+
| Field       | Type        | Null | Key | Default             | Extra                       |

| cYear2      | year(4)     | YES  |     | 0000                |                             |
| cTimeStamp  | timestamp   | NO   |     | CURRENT_TIMESTAMP   | on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP |
+-------------+-------------+------+-----+---------------------+-----------------------------+
Notes:
Don't use year(2) anymore.
From MySQL 5.7, the supported range for datetime is '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'.
Insert values manually using string literals.
mysql> INSERT INTO `datetime_arena` 
          (`description`, `cDateTime`, `cDate`, `cTime`, `cYear`, `cYear2`)
       VALUES 
          ('Manual Entry', '2001-01-01 23:59:59', '2002-02-02', '12:30:30', '2004', '05');
   
mysql> SELECT * FROM `datetime_arena` WHERE description='Manual Entry';
+--------------+---------------------+------------+----------+-------+--------+---------------------+
| description  | cDateTime           | cDate      | cTime    | cYear | cYear2 | cTimeStamp          |

+--------------+---------------------+------------+----------+-------+--------+---------------------+
Checking the on-update for TIMSTAMP.
mysql> UPDATE `datetime_arena` SET `cYear2`='99' WHERE description='Manual Entry';
   
mysql> SELECT * FROM `datetime_arena` WHERE description='Manual Entry';
+--------------+---------------------+------------+----------+-------+--------+---------------------+
| description  | cDateTime           | cDate      | cTime    | cYear | cYear2 | cTimeStamp          |

+--------------+---------------------+------------+----------+-------+--------+---------------------+
Insert values using MySQL built-in functions now(), curdate(), curtime().
mysql> INSERT INTO `datetime_arena` 
          (`description`, `cDateTime`, `cDate`, `cTime`, `cYear`, `cYear2`)
       VALUES 
          ('Built-in Functions', now(), curdate(), curtime(), now(), now());
   
mysql> SELECT * FROM `datetime_arena` WHERE description='Built-in Functions';
+--------------------+---------------------+------------+----------+-------+--------+---------------------+

+--------------------+---------------------+------------+----------+-------+--------+---------------------+
Insert invalid or out-of-range values. MySQL replaces with all zeros.
mysql> INSERT INTO `datetime_arena`
          (`description`, `cDateTime`, `cDate`, `cTime`, `cYear`, `cYear2`)
       VALUES 
          ('Error Input', '2001-13-31 23:59:59', '2002-13-31', '12:61:61', '99999', '999');
   
mysql> SELECT * FROM `datetime_arena` WHERE description='Error Input';
+-------------+---------------------+------------+----------+-------+--------+---------------------+
| description | cDateTime           | cDate      | cTime    | cYear | cYear2 | cTimeStamp          |

+-------------+---------------------+------------+----------+-------+--------+---------------------+
Note: Might not work in MySQL 5.7?!
An useful built-in function INTERVAL can be used to compute a future date, e.g.,
mysql> SELECT `cDate`, `cDate` + INTERVAL 30 DAY, `cDate` + INTERVAL 1 MONTH FROM `datetime_arena`;
+------------+---------------------------+----------------------------+
| cDate      | `cDate` + INTERVAL 30 DAY | `cDate` + INTERVAL 1 MONTH |
+------------+---------------------------+----------------------------+
| 2002-02-02 | 2002-03-04                | 2002-03-02                 |
| 2010-04-08 | 2010-05-08                | 2010-05-08                 |
| 0000-00-00 | NULL                      | NULL                       |
+------------+---------------------------+----------------------------+
5.3  View
A view is a virtual table that contains no physical data. It provide an alternative way to look at the data.

Example
-- Define a VIEW called supplier_view from products, suppliers and products_suppliers tables
mysql> CREATE VIEW supplier_view
       AS
       SELECT suppliers.name as `Supplier Name`, products.name as `Product Name`
       FROM products 
          JOIN suppliers ON products.productID = products_suppliers.productID
          JOIN products_suppliers ON suppliers.supplierID = products_suppliers.supplierID;
 
-- You can treat the VIEW defined like a normal table
mysql> SELECT * FROM supplier_view;
+---------------+--------------+
| Supplier Name | Product Name |
+---------------+--------------+
| ABC Traders   | Pencil 3B    |
| ABC Traders   | Pencil 4B    |
| ABC Traders   | Pencil 5B    |
| XYZ Company   | Pencil 6B    |
+---------------+--------------+
 
mysql> SELECT * FROM supplier_view WHERE `Supplier Name` LIKE 'ABC%';
+---------------+--------------+
| Supplier Name | Product Name |
+---------------+--------------+
| ABC Traders   | Pencil 3B    |
| ABC Traders   | Pencil 4B    |
| ABC Traders   | Pencil 5B    |
+---------------+--------------+
Example
mysql> DROP VIEW IF EXISTS patient_view;
  
mysql> CREATE VIEW patient_view
       AS
       SELECT 
          patientID AS ID, 
          name AS Name, 
          dateOfBirth AS DOB,
          TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, dateOfBirth, NOW()) AS Age
       FROM patients
       ORDER BY Age, DOB;
 
mysql> SELECT * FROM patient_view WHERE Name LIKE 'A%';
+------+---------+------------+------+
| ID   | Name    | DOB        | Age  |
+------+---------+------------+------+
| 1003 | Ali     | 2011-01-30 |    1 |
| 1001 | Ah Teck | 1991-12-31 |   20 |
+------+---------+------------+------+
  
mysql> SELECT * FROM patient_view WHERE age >= 18;
+------+---------+------------+------+
| ID   | Name    | DOB        | Age  |
+------+---------+------------+------+
| 1001 | Ah Teck | 1991-12-31 |   20 |
+------+---------+------------+------+
5.4  Transactions
A atomic transaction is a set of SQL statements that either ALL succeed or ALL fail. Transaction is important to ensure that there is no partial update to the database, given an atomic of SQL statements. Transactions are carried out via COMMIT and ROLLBACK.

Example
mysql> CREATE TABLE accounts (
          name     VARCHAR(30),
          balance  DECIMAL(10,2)
       );
 
mysql> INSERT INTO accounts VALUES ('Paul', 1000), ('Peter', 2000);
mysql> SELECT * FROM accounts;
+-------+---------+
| name  | balance |
+-------+---------+
| Paul  | 1000.00 |
| Peter | 2000.00 |
+-------+---------+
 
-- Transfer money from one account to another account
mysql> START TRANSACTION;
mysql> UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE name = 'Paul';
mysql> UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE name = 'Peter';
mysql> COMMIT;     -- Commit the transaction and end transaction
mysql> SELECT * FROM accounts;
+-------+---------+
| name  | balance |
+-------+---------+
| Paul  |  900.00 |
| Peter | 2100.00 |
+-------+---------+
 
mysql> START TRANSACTION;
mysql> UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE name = 'Paul';
mysql> UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE name = 'Peter';
mysql> ROLLBACK;    -- Discard all changes of this transaction and end Transaction
mysql> SELECT * FROM accounts;
+-------+---------+
| name  | balance |
+-------+---------+
| Paul  |  900.00 |
| Peter | 2100.00 |
+-------+---------+
If you start another mysql client and do a SELECT during the transaction (before the commit or rollback), you will not see the changes.

Alternatively, you can also disable the so-called autocommit mode, which is set by default and commit every single SQL statement.

-- Disable autocommit by setting it to false (0)
mysql> SET autocommit = 0;
mysql> UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE name = 'Paul';
mysql> UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE name = 'Peter';
mysql> COMMIT;
mysql> SELECT * FROM accounts;
+-------+---------+
| name  | balance |
+-------+---------+
| Paul  |  800.00 |
| Peter | 2200.00 |
+-------+---------+
 
mysql> UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE name = 'Paul';
mysql> UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE name = 'Peter';
mysql> ROLLBACK;
mysql> SELECT * FROM accounts;
+-------+---------+
| name  | balance |
+-------+---------+
| Paul  |  800.00 |
| Peter | 2200.00 |
+-------+---------+
 
mysql> SET autocommit = 1;   -- Enable autocommit
A transaction groups a set of operations into a unit that meets the ACID test:

Atomicity: If all the operations succeed, changes are committed to the database. If any of the operations fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and no change is made to the database. In other words, there is no partial update.
Consistency: A transaction transform the database from one consistent state to another consistent state.
Isolation: Changes to a transaction are not visible to another transaction until they are committed.
Durability: Committed changes are durable and never lost.
5.5  User Variables
In MySQL, you can define user variables via:

@varname :=value in a SELECT command, or
SET @varname := value or SET @varname = value command.
For examples,

mysql> SELECT @ali_dob := dateOfBirth FROM patients WHERE name = 'Ali';
mysql> SELECT name WHERE dateOfBirth < @ali_dob;
 
mysql> SET @today := CURDATE();
mysql> SELECT name FROM patients WHERE nextVisitDate = @today;
6.  More on JOIN
6.1  INNER JOIN
In an inner join of two tables, each row of the first table is combined (joined) with every row of second table. Suppose that there are n1 rows in the first table and n2 rows in the second table, INNER JOIN produces all combinations of n1×n2 rows - it is known as Cartesian Product or Cross Product.

Example
mysql> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1, t2;
 
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
          id      INT PRIMARY KEY,
          `desc`  VARCHAR(30)
       );
-- `desc` is a reserved word - must be back-quoted
 
mysql> CREATE TABLE t2 (
          id      INT PRIMARY KEY,
          `desc`  VARCHAR(30)
       );
 
mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES
         (1, 'ID 1 in t1'),
         (2, 'ID 2 in t1'),
         (3, 'ID 3 in t1');

mysql> INSERT INTO t2 VALUES
         (2, 'ID 2 in t2'),
         (3, 'ID 3 in t2'),
         (4, 'ID 4 in t2');
 
mysql> SELECT * FROM t1;
+----+------------+
| id | desc       |
+----+------------+
|  1 | ID 1 in t1 |
|  2 | ID 2 in t1 |
|  3 | ID 3 in t1 |
+----+------------+
 
mysql> SELECT * FROM t2;
+----+------------+
| id | desc       |
+----+------------+
|  2 | ID 2 in t2 |
|  3 | ID 3 in t2 |
|  4 | ID 4 in t2 |
+----+------------+
 
mysql> SELECT * 
       FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2;
+----+------------+----+------------+
| id | desc       | id | desc       |
+----+------------+----+------------+
|  1 | ID 1 in t1 |  2 | ID 2 in t2 |
|  2 | ID 2 in t1 |  2 | ID 2 in t2 |
|  3 | ID 3 in t1 |  2 | ID 2 in t2 |

-- SELECT all columns in t1 and t2 (*)
-- INNER JOIN produces ALL combinations of rows in t1 and t2
You can impose constrain by using the ON clause, for example,

mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
+----+------------+----+------------+
| id | desc       | id | desc       |
+----+------------+----+------------+
|  2 | ID 2 in t1 |  2 | ID 2 in t2 |
|  3 | ID 3 in t1 |  3 | ID 3 in t2 |
+----+------------+----+------------+
Take note that the following are equivalent:

mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;        -- default JOIN is INNER JOIN
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 CROSS JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;  -- Also called CROSS JOIN
 
-- You can use USING clause if the join-columns have the same name
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 USING (id);
+----+------------+------------+
| id | desc       | desc       |
+----+------------+------------+
|  2 | ID 2 in t1 | ID 2 in t2 |
|  3 | ID 3 in t1 | ID 3 in t2 |
+----+------------+------------+
   -- Only 3 columns in the result set, instead of 4 columns with ON clause
 
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id;  -- Use WHERE instead of ON
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id;            -- Use "commas" operator to join
6.2  OUTER JOIN - LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN
INNER JOIN with constrain (ON or USING) produces rows that are found in both tables. On the other hand, OUTER JOIN can produce rows that are in one table, but not in another table. There are two kinds of OUTER JOINs: LEFT JOIN produces rows that are in the left table, but may not in the right table; whereas RIGHT JOIN produces rows that are in the right table but may not in the left table.

In a LEFT JOIN, when a row in the left table does not match with the right table, it is still selected but by combining with a "fake" record of all NULLs for the right table.

mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
+----+------------+------+------------+
| id | desc       | id   | desc       |
+----+------------+------+------------+
|  1 | ID 1 in t1 | NULL | NULL       |
|  2 | ID 2 in t1 |    2 | ID 2 in t2 |
|  3 | ID 3 in t1 |    3 | ID 3 in t2 |
+----+------------+------+------------+
 
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 USING (id);
+----+------------+------------+
| id | desc       | desc       |
+----+------------+------------+
|  1 | ID 1 in t1 | NULL       |
|  2 | ID 2 in t1 | ID 2 in t2 |
|  3 | ID 3 in t1 | ID 3 in t2 |
+----+------------+------------+
 
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
+------+------------+----+------------+
| id   | desc       | id | desc       |
+------+------------+----+------------+
|    2 | ID 2 in t1 |  2 | ID 2 in t2 |
|    3 | ID 3 in t1 |  3 | ID 3 in t2 |
| NULL | NULL       |  4 | ID 4 in t2 |
+------+------------+----+------------+
 
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 USING (id);
+----+------------+------------+
| id | desc       | desc       |
+----+------------+------------+
|  2 | ID 2 in t2 | ID 2 in t1 |
|  3 | ID 3 in t2 | ID 3 in t1 |
|  4 | ID 4 in t2 | NULL       |
+----+------------+------------+
As the result, LEFT JOIN ensures that the result set contains every row on the left table. This is important, as in some queries, you are interested to have result on every row on the left table, with no match in the right table, e.g., searching for items without supplier. For example,

mysql> SELECT t1.id, t1.desc
       FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 USING (id)
       WHERE t2.id IS NULL;
+----+------------+
| id | desc       |
+----+------------+
|  1 | ID 1 in t1 |
+----+------------+
Take note that the followings are equivalent:

mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
 
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 USING (id);  -- join-columns have same name
+----+------------+------------+
| id | desc       | desc       |
+----+------------+------------+
|  1 | ID 1 in t1 | NULL       |
|  2 | ID 2 in t1 | ID 2 in t2 |
|  3 | ID 3 in t1 | ID 3 in t2 |
+----+------------+------------+
 
-- WHERE clause CANNOT be used on OUTER JOIN
mysql> SELECT *
       FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id;

7.1  Rental System
Peter runs a small car rental company with 10 cars and 5 trucks. He engages you to design a web portal to put his operation online.

For the initial phase, the web portal shall provide these basic functions:

Maintaining the records of the vehicles and customers.
Inquiring about the availability of vehicle, and
Reserving a vehicle for rental.
A customer record contains his/her name, address and phone number.

A vehicle, identified by the vehicle registration number, can be rented on a daily basis. The rental rate is different for different vehicles. There is a discount of 20% for rental of 7 days or more.

A customer can rental a vehicle from a start date to an end date. A special customer discount, ranging from 0-50%, can be given to preferred customers.

Database
The initial database contains 3 tables: vehicles, customers, and rental_records. The rental_records is a junction table supporting many-to-many relationship between vehicles and customers.
