19. 70, 54, 45, 41……. What is the next number in the given series?
a. 35
b. 36
c. 38
d. 40
Correct option: d
Explanation:
Consecutive squares are subtracted from the numbers.
70 - 54 = 16
54 - 45 = 9
45 - 41 = 4
So next we have to subtract 1. So answer = 41 - 1 = 40

d. 34
Correct option:
Explanation:
Single digit number = 4
Double digit number = 4××3 = 12
Three digit numbers = 3××3××2= 18 (∵∵ If Hundred's place is 5, then the number is greater than 500)
Total = 34.

a. 145
b. 178
c. 176
d. 191
Explanation:
11,23,47,83,131
23–11 = 12
47–23 = 24
83–47 = 36
131–83 = 48

total sum of publication year was 13, 524. First book was published in?
a. 1911
b. 1910
c. 2002
d. 1932
Answer:
Explanation:
Let the years be n, n+7, n+14, ...., n+42. (∵∵ use formula Tn=a+(n−1)dTn=a+(n−1)d to find nth term)
Sum = Sn=n2(2a+(n−1)d)Sn=n2(2a+(n−1)d) = 72(2n+(7−1)7)72(2n+(7−1)7) = 13,524
⇒7n+147=13,524⇒7n+147=13,524
⇒⇒ n = 1911
3. Crusoe hatched from a mysterious egg discovered by Angus, was growing at a fast pace that Angus 
had to move it from home to the lake. Given the weights of Crusoe in its first weeks of birth as 5, 15,

a) 3645 
b) 135 
c) 30 
d) 15
Answer: c
Explanation:
5×3 = 15
15×3 = 45 ⇒⇒ Given as 30
45×3 = 135
135×3 = 405
405×3 = 1215
1215×3 = 3645
4. A can complete a piece of work in 8 hours, B can complete in 10 hours and C in 12 hours. If A,B, C 
start the work together but A laves after 2 hours. Find the time taken by B and C to complete the 
remaining work.
1) 2 (1/11) hours
2) 4 (1/11) hours
3) 2 (6/11) hours
4) 2 hours
Explanation:
A,B,C's 1 hour work is = 18+110+11218+110+112 = 15+12+10120=3712015+12+10120=37120
A,B,C worked together for 2 hours, Therefore, 2 hours work is = 37120×2=376037120×2=3760
Remaining work = 1−3760=23601−3760=2360
(23/60 work is done by B and C together)
B, C's 1 hour work = 110+112=6+560=1160110+112=6+560=1160
(2360)th(2360)th part of the work done by B, C in = (2360)1160(2360)1160 = 21112111 hours.




8. A sum of Rs.3000 is distributed among A, B, and C. A gets 2/3 of what B and C got together and c gets 
1/3 of what A and B got together, C's share is?
Explanation:
Let B+C together got 3 units, then A get 2 units. or B+CA=32B+CA=32 - - - (1)
Let A+B together got 3 units, then B get 1 units. or A+BC=31A+BC=31 - - - (2)
By using Componendo and Dividendo, we can re-write equations (1) and 
(2), A+B+CA=3+22=52=208A+B+CA=3+22=52=208 and A+B+CC=3+11=41=205A+B+CC=3+11=41=2
05
So A = 8, B = 7, C = 5
C's share = 5(8+5+7)×3000=7505(8+5+7)×3000=750
9. The numbers 272738 and 232342, when divided by n, a two digit number, leave a remainder of 13 and 
17 respectively. Find the sum of the digits of n?
a. 7
b. 8
c. 5
d. 4
Explanation:
From the given information, (272738 - 13, 232342 - 17) are exactly divisible by that two digit number.
We have to find the HCF of the given numbers 272725, 232325. 
HCF = 25.
So sum of the digits = 7.
10. Assume that f(1)=0 and f(m+n)=f(m)+f(n)+4(9mn-1). For all natural numbers (Integers>0)m and n. 
 What is the value of f(17)? 
a. 5436
b. 4831
c. 5508
d. 4832
Explanation:
f(1) = 0
f(2) = f(1+1) = f(1)+f(1)+4(9×1×1 – 1) = 0+0+4×8 = 32
f(4) = f(2+2) = f(2)+f(2)+4(9×2×2 – 1) = 32+32+4×35 = 204
f(8) = f(4+4) = f(4)+f(4)+4(9×4×4 – 1) = 204+204+4×143 = 980
f(16) = f(8+8) = f(8)+f(8)+4(9×8×8 – 1) = 980+980+4×575 = 4260
f(17) = f(1+16) = f(16)+f(1)+4(9×16×1 –1) = 4260+0+ 4×143 = 4832
11. The perimeter of a equilateral triangle and regular hexagon are equal. Find out the ratio of their 
areas?
a. 3:2
b. 2:3
c. 1:6
d. 6:1
Correct Option: b
Explanation:
Let the side of the equilateral triangle = aa units and side of the regular hexagon is bb units.
Given that, 3a=6b3a=6b ⇒ab=21⇒ab=21
Now ratio of the areas of equilateral triangle and hexagon = 3√4a2:33√2b234a2:332b2
⇒3√4(2)2:33√2(1)2⇒34(2)2:332(1)2
⇒2:3⇒2:3
12. What is the remainder of (32^31^301) when it is divided by 9?
a. 3
b. 5
c. 2
d. 1
Correct option: b
Explanation:
See solved example 6 here
3231301932313019 = 53130195313019
Euler totient theorem says that [aϕ(n)n]Rem=1[aϕ(n)n]Rem=1
ϕ(n)=n(1−1a)(1−1b)...ϕ(n)=n(1−1a)(1−1b)... here n=ap.bq...n=ap.bq...
Now ϕ(9)=9(1−13)=6ϕ(9)=9(1−13)=6
Therefore, 5656 when divided by 9 remainder 1.
Now 313016=1301=1313016=1301=1
So 3130131301 can be written as 6k + 1
⇒531301=(56)K.51⇒531301=(56)K.51
5313019=(56)K.519=1K.59=55313019=(56)K.519=1K.59=5
13. Which of the following numbers must be added to 5678 to give a reminder 35 when divided by 460?
a. 980
b. 797
c. 955
d. 618
Correct option: b
Explanation:
Let xx be the number to be added to 5678.
When you divide 5678 + xx by 460 the remainder = 35.
Therefore, 5678 + xx = 460k + 35 here kk is some quotient.
⇒⇒ 5643 + xx should exactly divisible by 460.
Now from the given options x = 797.
14. A girl entered a store and bought x flowers for y dollars (x and y are integers). When she was about to 
leave, the clerk said, “If you buy 10 more flowers I will give you all for $$2, and you will save 80 cents a 
dozen”. The values of x and y are:
a. (15,1)
b. (10,1)
c. (5,1)
d. Cannot be determined from the given information.
Correct option: c
Explanation:
Given she bought xx flowers for yy dollars.
So 1 flower cost = yxyx
12 flowers or 1 dozen cost = 12yx12yx
Again, xx+10 cost = 2 dollars
1 flower cost = 210+x210+x
12 flowers or 1 dozen cost = 2×1210+x=2410+x2×1210+x=2410+x
Given that this new dozen cost is 80 cents or 4/5 dollar less than original cost.
⇒12yx−2410+x=45⇒12yx−2410+x=45
From the given options, c satisfies this.
15. If a number is divided by 357 the remainder is 5, what will be the remainder if the number is divided 
by 17?
a. 9
b. 3
c. 5
d. 7
Correct option: c
Explanation:
Let ′N′′N′ be the given number.
N=357k+5N=357k+5 = 17×21k+517×21k+5
If this number is divided by 17 remainder is 5 as 357k is exactly divided by 17.
16. In how many possible ways can write 3240 as a product of 3 positive integers a,b and c.
a. 450
b. 420
c. 350
d. 320
Correct option:
Explanation:
3450=23×34×51=a×b×c3450=23×34×51=a×b×c
We have to distribute three 2's to a, b, c in 3+3−1C3−1=5C2=103+3−1C3−1=5C2=10 ways
We have to distribute four 3's to a, b, c in 3+4−1C3−1=6C2=153+4−1C3−1=6C2=15 ways
We have to distribute one 5 to a, b, c in 3 ways.
Total ways = 10×15×3=45010×15×3=450 ways.
17. On door A - It leads to freedom
On door B - It leads to Ghost house
On door C - door B leads to Ghost house
The statement written on one of the doors is wrong.
Identify which door leads to freedom.
a. A
b. B
c. C
d. None
Correct option: c
Explanation:
Case 1: A, B are true. In this case, Statement C also correct. So contradiction.
Case 2: B, C are true. In this case, B leads to ghost house and C confirms it. Now A is wrong. So door A 
does not lead to freedom. So Door C leads to freedom.
