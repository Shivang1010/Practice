total sum of publication year was 13, 524. First book was published in?
a. 1911
b. 1910
c. 2002
d. 1932
Answer:
Explanation:
Let the years be n, n+7, n+14, ...., n+42. (∵∵ use formula Tn=a+(n−1)dTn=a+(n−1)d to find nth term)
Sum = Sn=n2(2a+(n−1)d)Sn=n2(2a+(n−1)d) = 72(2n+(7−1)7)72(2n+(7−1)7) = 13,524
⇒7n+147=13,524⇒7n+147=13,524
⇒⇒ n = 1911

a) 3645 
b) 135 
c) 30 
d) 15
Answer: c
Explanation:
5×3 = 15
15×3 = 45 ⇒⇒ Given as 30
45×3 = 135
135×3 = 405
405×3 = 1215
1215×3 = 3645
4. A can complete a piece of work in 8 hours, B can complete in 10 hours and C in 12 hours. If A,B, C 
start the work together but A laves after 2 hours. Find the time taken by B and C to complete the 
remaining work.
1) 2 (1/11) hours
2) 4 (1/11) hours
3) 2 (6/11) hours
4) 2 hours
Explanation:
A,B,C's 1 hour work is = 18+110+11218+110+112 = 15+12+10120=3712015+12+10120=37120
A,B,C worked together for 2 hours, Therefore, 2 hours work is = 37120×2=376037120×2=3760
Remaining work = 1−3760=23601−3760=2360
(23/60 work is done by B and C together)
B, C's 1 hour work = 110+112=6+560=1160110+112=6+560=1160
(2360)th(2360)th part of the work done by B, C in = (2360)1160(2360)1160 = 21112111 hours.
